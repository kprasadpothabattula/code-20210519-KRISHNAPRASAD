## As requested to build a standalone application, I didn't use express to build a rest API,
## and I am considering input given as a JSON file.

## Start the project
```bash
$ npm i
```
## Place your input in inputData folder with file name data.json
```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```
## The final output will be saved in outputData folder and Count the total number of overweight people will show in console log

## to run the test cases
```bash
$ npm test
```
